# OpenSourceSetups.x10.mx
A repository of the iRacing NASCAR setups available on the web site <strong>OpenSourceSetups.x10.mx</strong> and it's mirror <strong>OpenSetups.win</strong> previously known as <strong>OpenSetups.ml</strong>

If anyone wants to contribute I'm going to figure out someway that setups can be provided from the community.  For right now either make a pull request or message me here.  To be totally honest I know there is a lot more speed to be found in my setups.  I almost never run telemetry and just dial the car in by the seat of my pants.  I am 100% positive if someone wanted to take the time to analyze the data and see exactly what the car is doing there is a ton more speed to be unlocked.  If not that's cool as well.  

At somepoint in the hopefully not too distant future I'm going to publish a wiki either here or on the website with links, vids, and a brief tutorial on how to use telemetry sessions, how to analyze a session in MOTEC, and some things to look for.  If I had the time to devote I'd do it each week, unfortunately many weeks I don't manage to get a setup published till Sat night.  If I took any more time then I could probably have a setup ready by the Wednesday of the following week.  Maybe. 

This repository and the website are dedicated to late best friend George "Crash" Cecil.  He used to help me dial the car in nearly every week and I never gave him the credit that he deserved.  Rest in Peace brother.

**There was an update to the tire model for the NASCAR NextGen cars on 06/2025, any setup created before that date is going to need to be redialed in or scrapped all together.**
