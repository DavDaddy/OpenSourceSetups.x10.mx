See the notes in the setup in sim for 241-DX.  It is a slightly modified version of the "231-DavRace" setup from the previous year.  
It's faster on a short run but tends to fall off more if the RF gets hot.

Just run 241-DavRace that sucker is bad fast and good on tires!  If you dodge wrecks it's a top 0 car all day long.  
Change tape and 241-DX would be a good Q set.
