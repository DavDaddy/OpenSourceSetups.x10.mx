The first setup is from early in testing.  The other 2 are more developed but that doesn't guarantee better.  It is very hard for me to set a car up for this track because I'm so bad here, it's very hard to tell if the problem is my driving or the car.  

READ THE NOTES in the garage, in sim!  If you don't you are very likely to have a rude surprise during the race!
