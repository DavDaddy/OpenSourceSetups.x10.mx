252-DavidHoskins-Bristol(paved)-DavRace.sto  It's a fast setup, see the notes in the garage in sim for details.

242-DavidHoskins-Bristol(paved)-DX1.sto is a good long run set, likes to run the middle to high lane.  Tends to eat up the left front tire if you run the bottom for too long.  *See notes in garage in sim.
