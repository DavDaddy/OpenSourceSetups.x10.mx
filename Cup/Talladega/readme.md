*I found the 232-DavRace setup, while fast as heck pushing, would drag the front end once you're in the lead and slow you down significantly.  

232-DavRace1 has the whole car raised up along with more air pressure all the way around.  I haven't had time to shake it down yet so use at your own risk.

**234-Talladega-DavRace, Just got 4th in 2600 split NIS race with this set. Read the notes in the garage in sim!
