**234-Talladega-DavRace-alt is an alternative setup to DavRace above. Duh!  It does better leading but doesn't get monster runs like the original.  See the notes in the garage in sim for details and credit to the original creator.  You can't go wrong; either of these setups both are race winners!

**234-Talladega-DavRace, Just got 4th in a 2600 split NIS race with this set. Read the notes in the garage in sim! 

*I found the 232-DavRace setup, while fast as heck pushing, would drag the front end once you're in the lead and slow you down significantly.  

232-DavRace1 has the whole car raised up along with more air pressure all the way around.  I haven't had time to shake it down yet so use at your own risk.
